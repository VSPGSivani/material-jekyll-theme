I'm a *passionate* violinist from India. I'm a **Telugu** native and had primary tutelage under my mother, **_Smt. Arundhati Vishnubhotla_**. My father's **_Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Murthy_**. I initially set out as a *vocalist*, but later was carried out by the violin. I'm currently learning at **_Sri G. Srinivasa Murthy_** and **_Smt. Narmada Gopalakrishnan_**, daughter of the late legend **_Sri MS Gopalakrishnan_**.
